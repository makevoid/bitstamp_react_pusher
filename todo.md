TODO: idea for a form components plugin
---

string parse to html elements - node / js / opal mixin

    [] = checkbox (unchecked)
    
    [x] = checkbox (checked)
    
    () = radio buttons
    
etc..

api: `el("string")` - `el "string"` (opal)

the name its taken from the label, the collection name from the outher element
